                    Engoo is an online language interface connecting students with professional tutors worldwide for
                    personalised English lessons. The platform specialises in one-on-one video call lessons,
                    catering to all proficiency levels. However, the platform currently faces challenges in
                    providing a smooth user experience for tutor
                    selection, leading to confusion and an overwhelming experience for students in their academic
                    journey.

                    from all around the world. It specialises
                    in one-on-one lessons via video call, catering to learners on all levels, from beginning to

                        <p>
                            Currently, <strong class="strong-highlight">Engoo fails to ensure there’s a smooth and
                                user-friendly interaction when selecting a

                            </strong>
                            users often find it challenging to make informed decisions about their tutors and where
                            to begin.
                            This leads to confusion and an overwhelming experience for students.
                            <strong class="strong-highlight"> The platform lacks personalised profiles </strong>,
                            making the
                            system ineffective for matching users with tutors based on personality,
                            preferences, and learning needs. As a result, students must conduct manual research for
                            each session,
                            and tutors remain uncertain about lesson preparation. Additionally, this makes the

                    <article class="context-item">
                        <h3>Why This Context Matters</h3>
                        <p>
                            The definition of user experience refers to a user’s journey and perspective of an
                            interaction. By analyzing Engoo’s ‘Our Tutor’ page from a student’s logged-in
                            perspective, we can enhance the tutor selection process based on users’ needs, wants,
                            and expectations.

                            <br><br>
                            This issue is crucial because tutors must understand students’ motives and needs to
                            tailor
                            their teaching effectively. <strong class="strong-highlight"> Students also need to feel
                                as
                                if their profile authentically represents them and fosters a sense of connection to
                                the
                                server, </strong> making them feel part of a community. Addressing this will improve
                            engagement
                            and ease of use.

                            <h2>Chow Bookings</h2>
                            <p>Chow is a restaurant offering Fresh Asian Cuisine in Wellington. Their online booking
                                system is
                                efficient and user-friendly, guiding customers seamlessly through the reservation
                                process. Engoo could
                                benefit from adopting a similar approach to tutor scheduling, providing a smooth and
                                intuitive booking
                                system to enhance the user experience for both tutors and students.</p>

                            <p>Victoria University’s course advisor booking system shares similarities with Chow’s
                                approach, offering
                                a simple and straightforward process for students to select a date and time with their
                                advisor. Colour
                                coordination helps students easily identify their selected booking day, and time clarity
                                reduces
                                confusion during the process.</p>

                            <p>Facebook profiles are personalised spaces where users can share their interests and

                                encourages engagement, similar to how Engoo should foster positive interactions between
                                students and
                                tutors. By allowing both parties to connect more deeply, Engoo can create a comfortable
                                and engaging
                                learning environment.</p>

                        <h3>Design Brief</h3>
                    </section>

                    <section class="separator"></section>

                    <h3>Identify UX Problem:</h3>
                    <p>Engoo currently struggles to ensure a smooth and user-friendly experience when selecting a tutor.
                        Users
                        often feel overwhelmed by the large number of available tutors, making it difficult to make
                        informed
                        decisions.</p>

                    <h3>Design Outcome:</h3>
                    <p>Our design solution focuses on improving communication and organisation. By creating a more
                        functional,
                        usable, and scalable system, users will be able to navigate seamlessly, select dates, and find
                        tutors that
                        match their needs and preferences. The solution will feature an interactive flow with intuitive
                        interfaces,
                        clear visual cues, a progress bar, and personalised recommendations, leading to a more effective
                        and enjoyable
                        experience.</p>

                    <h3>To Achieve This:</h3>
                    <p><strong class="strong-highlight">Personalized Profile:</strong> Engoo currently lacks a personal
                        profile feature,
                        which makes it difficult to match students with tutors based on personality, preferences, and
                        learning
                        needs. By incorporating personalised profiles right after signing in, we can offer a smooth
                        transition into
                        the system.</p>

                    <p>This profile will gather learning preferences, personality traits, and specific needs, helping
                        the system
                        suggest more accurate tutor matches.</p>

                    <p><strong class="strong-highlight">Calendar System:</strong> The current calendar lacks clarity and
                        usability.
                        Users have reported frustration with the excessive empty space and unclear structure. To address
                        this,
                        we will implement a simple calendar interface with real-time availability updates, taking
                        inspiration from
                        the VUW course advisor system. The calendar will allow users to easily select dates and times
                        for their
                        tutor sessions in a streamlined manner.</p>

                    <h3>Importance:</h3>
                    <p><strong class="strong-highlight">Building a schedule is crucial for design projects</strong> as
                        it ensures each
                        phase is completed on time and with structure. A well-organised schedule <strong
                            class="strong-highlight">helps
                            manage resources effectively and maintains focus</strong> throughout the project.</p>

                    <p>Additionally, incorporating user testing is vital throughout the process. Testing ensures the
                        final design
                        meets user expectations rather than the designer’s assumptions. By conducting 5 usability tests
                        with clear
                        scenarios, we will gather invaluable feedback on the user experience.</p>
